**Primary Option:**

3D printed hammer head with hollow aluminum handle for batteries

Advantages:
  * High feature detail
  * Allows for nearly on the fly changes in design until finalized and printed
  * Decently high durability if designed properly
  * Personally Iâ€™ve had a lot of experience with printing, knowing common oversight in design

Disadvantages:
  * Cost of the 3D printing material, current unskeletonized volume is approx 30in^3

**Secondary Option:**

Wood fabricated hammer head with hollow aluminum handle for batteries

Advantages:
  * Can have relatively high detail, but requires a lot of time
  * Durable
  * Cheap

Disadvantages:
  * Lack of extensive wood handling skills makes this option unattractive personally

**Tertiary Option:**

Hollow aluminum hammer head with hollow aluminum handle for batteries

Advantages:
  * Most durable

Disadvantages:
  * Machining time
  * Certain features nearly require the use of CNC mill, which is currently not easily available
  * Potential for the head to act as a faraday cage, though a wall could be made out of plastic or wood to defeat this.

**Current Design:**
